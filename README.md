# Active Campaign v3 PHP Wrapper

## Installation

```bash
composer require idearia/activecampaign-v3-php
```

## Local Development

To install the dependencies, run

```bash
composer install
npm i
```

NPM is required to format the code, since we use [a PHP Plugin for Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php).

### Static Analysis

We use [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) for static analysis.
